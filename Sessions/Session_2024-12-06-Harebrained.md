# Session 2024‑12‑06 — “Banking, Boons & Bargains”

## Overview
Party returned from the **Malian Gates** after meeting **Kaleva** and surviving an eldritch encounter. Tannock triggered a burst of borrowed power from a *beep‑boop‑bop* ally that disrupted an incoming manifest/portal. Back in the city, the crew handled payouts, banking, training plans, shopping, and downtime jobs.

## Key Events
- **Payouts:** Everyone received **200 gp** plus **100 gp** in silver shards from the previous job.  
- **Bank scene:** Visited the **Banking Guild** (emblem featuring a winged leonine figure, read as a manticore).  
- **Obsidian Eye Relic:** Group has an obsidian object with an eye motif; later identified as a spellcasting focus that, when held, lets the bearer use a reaction to reduce **necrotic** damage by **1d4** (per use).  
- **Training talk:** Group discussed feat training time/costs and narrative teachers.  
- **Downtime jobs:** Agreed to take **two middling jobs** (200 gp each) for **400 gp** per character during downtime, with limits to avoid over‑exertion.

## Loot & Purchases
- **Cloak of Protection** — 585 gp (after bundle discount)
- **Ioun Stone (Protection)** — 520 gp (after bundle discount)
- **Ivory Goat** — 552 gp (after bundle discount)
- **Feather Token (Anchor)** — 32.5 gp (after bundle discount)
- **Bundle Deal:** 35% off when bundling four items.

> [!note] Party Funds
> See each character sheet for final gold after purchases and job payouts.

## Training & Prices (agreed guidance)
- **Ritual Caster** — 350 gp (House Sivis contact recommended); learned via schooling narrative
- **Skilled** — 250 gp (revised from initial)
- **Skill Expert** — 400 gp
- **Piercer (half‑feat)** — ~400 gp
- **Cartomancer** — 400 gp
- **War Caster** — commonly chosen; pricing treated similar to other core feats (≈350–500 gp depending on mentor)
- **Keen Mind / Alert / Lucky** — considered “special/earned” and may require quests/time rather than just gold
- **Training time:** ~1–2 weeks depending on mentor; pushing more activities risks exhaustion/complications

## Jobs Board (Downtime)
- **Trivial** — ~50 gp; up to **3×** per downtime window
- **Middling** — ~200 gp; up to **2×** (group chose **2×** → **400 gp** each)
- **Difficult** — deferred (would become an on‑camera mini‑quest)
- Example posting: House Orien courier/bodyguard runs between Skyway and Lower Dura (~200 gp each)

## NPCs & Factions Mentioned
- **Kaleva** — contact from prior delve.
- **Banking Guild** (House Karinuk emblem observed; noted as manticore iconography).

## Items & Artifacts
- **Obsidian Eye Focus** — necrotic‑reducing reaction (1d4) when held; also functions as a focus.
- **Ambrosia Design** branded gear noted as expensive/“fashion premium.”

## Open Threads / Follow‑ups
- Who should keep the **Obsidian Eye** long‑term? Trade‑up later?
- Formalize downtime job tables (risk vs reward).
- Identify teachers/mentors for feat training (War Caster duo training idea).
- Potential future work with **The Twelve** and scry‑tech (“Lustrum”) demo.
