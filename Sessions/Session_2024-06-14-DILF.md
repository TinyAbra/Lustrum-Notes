# Session 2024‑06‑14 — “DILF”

## Overview
The party regrouped after the previous mission with several key revelations. Delilah reconnected with an old halfling friend Carla Boulevard in the Little Plains district, receiving news of legal troubles involving the Boulevard clan. A new half‑orc contact, **Ro**, joined the party, already familiar with Lucas and Tanek. Ro revealed she is investigating **Dr. Albin** and disappearances in **Droaam**, suspecting experimentation.

## Key Events
- **Memory Shards:** Lucas produced arcane‑locked memory shards. Jane extracted their resonance into vaporous form, revealing recorded thoughts from a version of Tanek discussing experiments on Droaam inhabitants.
- **Lucas’ Family:** Albin was heard referencing Lucas’ mother, tracking her down.
- **Emotional Fallout:** Tanek struggled with hearing echoes of his “past self.” Lucas and Tanek were unsettled.
- **Vision & Dream:** Lucas later experienced a collapse during an Identify ritual, whispering *“The balance is shifting”* before blacking out. In a vivid dream, he was contacted by a hag identified as **Sora Teraza** (one of the Daughters of Sora Kell, “the Dream of Droaam”), who claimed a bond with his mother.
- **New Motifs:** The dream hinted at Tanek’s heart being a potential “key” to planar gates and forces of perfect order (Mechanus).

## Breakfast Planning
- Party discussed spell choices, positioning in fights, and breakfast banter (notably, pancakes and orange juice).  
- Ro appeared emotionally drained but proposed focusing on Dr. Albin’s next moves.  
- The **Emerald Claw** was identified as a dangerous faction meddling with Albin’s research, linked to necromancy and Mabar.

## NPCs & Factions
- **Carla Boulevard** — Halfling lawyer in Little Plains.  
- **Ro** — Half‑orc ally, tied to Lucas and Tanek. Investigates Dr. Albin.  
- **Dr. Albin** — Vampire, linked to experiments.  
- **Emerald Claw** — Violent extremist sect tied to necromancy, potential involvement in Albin’s schemes.  
- **Sora Teraza** — Hag of Droaam, “the Dream of Droaam,” contacted Lucas in vision.  

## Open Threads
- What are the Emerald Claw’s true motives in Albin’s work?  
- Significance of Lucas’ new green sphere mark.  
- Further exploration of the plane of **Mechanus (Order)**.  
- Ro’s sources at Margrave University may provide more intel.
