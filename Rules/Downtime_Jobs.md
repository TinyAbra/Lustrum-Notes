# Downtime Jobs

**Caps per downtime window (guidance):**
- Trivial — ~50 gp each, up to **3×**
- Middling — ~200 gp each, up to **2×** (party chose **2×** → **400 gp** each)
- Difficult — deferred (would be an on‑camera mini‑quest, ~900–1000 gp total mission payout)

**Risk/Overload:** Taking more than the caps or combining with heavy training may cause exhaustion or other narrative complications (broken gear, sickness, enemies made, etc.).
